Rules: The goal of this game is for the character to catch the falling pink balls. If the character touches
a falling bomb or if the pink ball touches the ground then it will display "Game Over" on the screen.
If the character touches the bomb, a bomb explosion image will display on the screen.

Unique:
1)I added bombs that are slower and less than the falling bombs in which if one is touched, an explosion occurs
2)I've added bounds for the character so it doesn't go out of the window screen.
3)I've implemented a press space bar to restart game function in which after it's game over, the user can
press space bar to continue.
4)I implemented scoring shown on the terminal since we never rendered text in our game engine
